CS F372 (Operating Systems) Assignment
Emulation of **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** and **Round Robin (RR)** Scheduling Algorithms in C

### Folders
- **header_files**: Contains required structures, function prototypes and header files
- **misc**: Python programs to plot points, generate numbers and a wrapper bash script to generate points
- **points_and_graph_plots**: Contains points present in csv files and graph plots for the generated points
- **source_files**: main program that handles FCFS and RR scheduling and thread functions that perform their tasks

To run the program (works only in a Linux system): 
1. Clone this repository into your folder
2. Open terminal and go to the `cs-f372-assignment` folder
3. Run `make` to compile the source_files
4. Then execute `./output.out` to simulate the scheduling.
